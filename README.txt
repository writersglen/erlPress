=============
erlPress_core
=============

erlPress_core modifies and extends the Hugh Watkins fork of the Erlang Erlguten library originally developed by Joe Armstrong.

https://github.com/hwatkins/erlguten

erlPress_core is the base library for many as-yet-to_be-developed Erlang applications for creative print media and publishing tools.

To review current erlPpress_core functionality, display ../pdf/galleys/ep_show_n_tell.pdf.

To see ep_show_n_tell.pdf source, see ../tests/ep_show_n_tell.erl.

See ../src/guides/prograpmmer_guide.txt for programming details. 

ErlPress_core, is a work-in-progress. Should you find deficiencies and rough-edges, we'd love to hear abouat them. The MIT license encourages evolution toward world-class print-media design and development applications ranging from business cards to books.

Imagine:

. Easy-to-use documentation tools

. An application for development of marketing collateral along the lines Scribus, but web-based

. An Erlang-based book-publishing pipeline
