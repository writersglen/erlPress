Genesis

erlPress revises and extends ErlGuten, Joe Armstrong’s Erlang-based “system for high-quality typesetting.”

It honors and strives to advance Joe’s original goals:

— Easy to use – simple textual input

— Multi-mode inputs (suited for technical reports, magazine layout and presentations)

— Very high quality layout engine (better than TeX, in-design, quark etc.)

erlPress further draws on excellent work by Hugh Hawkins, Carl Wright and others who have carried forward Joe’s vision.

Hugh Hawkins modestly describes ErlGuten as a “PDF generation application.” Thus, Adobe reference manual Version 1.4 is the inspiration and blueprint underlying ErlGuten.

https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive.html

Developed in the early 1990’s by Adobe, PDF is “a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create them and of the output device on which they are to be displayed or printed.”

PDF reference manual Version 1.4 p. 9

PDF is based on the industry standard Postscript programming language developed by Adobe in 1985. Postscript, in turn, is an implementation of Adobe’s imaging model which, simply stated, models “paint” placed on a page in selected areas.

Adobe reference manual Version 1.4 p. 32

ErlGuten brings PDF and Postscript to Erlang. But ErlGuten as a diamond in the rough. It’s font handling and typesetting routines are particularly noteworthy. But, despite work by several contributors, ErlGuten it fall short of promised goals.

Editorial work flow

erlPress is inspired by traditions of the commercial editorial and 
publishing world.  In this world, print matter is created by
specialist professionals: 


-- Client or publisher commissions an editorial project; e.g. job
   and specifies format; e.g. postcard, newsletter, book

-- Writers create articles or manuscripts; e.g. text also known as copy

-- Photographers/photo editors generate images

-- Illustrators generate images

-- Editors assign writers; edit articles or manuscript

-- Graphic designer specifies type; e.g. fonts, faces, sizes

-- Typesetters type set articles or manuscript

-- Editors proof typeset copy

-- Graphic designer creates page layouts, pastes up typeset copy, 
   and images

-- Printer prints one or more copies 


Note that the functions above may be executed by more than one person.

erlPress is concerned mainly with editorial processes resulting in PDF 
files. These files, in turn, may be printed in quantity on a desktop 
printer for distribution or given to a commercial printer for reproduction.
