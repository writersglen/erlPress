ErlPress

erlPress is a system for “painting” text and images on print media. It enables document creators to generate typographically sophisticated PDF documents and publications from within Erlang applications.

erlPress is Open Source, flexible, and easy to use.

Genesis

erlPress revises and extends ErlGuten, Joe Armstrong’s Erlang-based “system for high-quality typesetting.”

It honors and strives to advance Joe’s original goals:

— Easy to use – simple textual input

— Multi-mode inputs (suited for technical reports, magazine layout and presentations)

— Very high quality layout engine (better than TeX, in-design, quark etc.)

http://erlang.org/euc/04/erlguten.pdf
http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2003-March/008001.html

erlPress further draws on excellent work by Hugh Hawkins, Carl Wright and others who have carried forward Joe’s vision.

https://github.com/hwatkins/erlguten
https://github.com/richcarl/erlguten

Hugh Hawkins modestly describes ErlGuten as a “PDF generation application.” Thus, Adobe reference manual Version 1.4 is the inspiration and blueprint underlying ErlGuten.

https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive.html

Developed in the early 1990’s by Adobe, PDF is “a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create them and of the output device on which they are to be displayed or printed.”

PDF reference manual Version 1.4 p. 9

PDF is based on the industry standard Postscript programming language developed by Adobe in 1985. Postscript, in turn, is an implementation of Adobe’s imaging model which, simply stated, models “paint” placed on a page in selected areas.

Adobe reference manual Version 1.4 p. 32

ErlGuten brings PDF and Postscript to Erlang. But ErlGuten as a diamond in the rough. It’s font handling and typesetting routines are particularly noteworthy. But, despite work by several contributors, ErlGuten it fall short of promised goals.

erlPress

ErlPress strives to advance ErlGuten in several ways:

— Improve code readability and documentation

— Reorganize code for easier maintenance and extensibility

— Provide user interfaces and terminology more aligned with editorial, graphic design, and print traditions and practices

— Provide support for extended Markdown input

— Provide libraries for easy development of conventional print formats ranging from business cards, invoices, and reports to books and magazines.

%% *****************************************************************


Editorial work flow

erlPress is inspired by traditions of the commercial editorial and 
publishing world.  In this world, print matter is created by
specialist professionals: 


-- Client or publisher commissions an editorial project; e.g. job
   and specifies format; e.g. postcard, newsletter, book

-- Writers create articles or manuscripts; e.g. text also known as copy

-- Photographers/photo editors generate images

-- Illustrators generate images

-- Editors assign writers; edit articles or manuscript

-- Graphic designer specifies type; e.g. fonts, faces, sizes

-- Typesetters type set articles or manuscript

-- Editors proof typeset copy

-- Graphic designer creates page layouts, pastes up typeset copy, 
   and images

-- Printer prints one or more copies 


Note that the functions above may be executed by more than one person.

erlPress is concerned mainly with editorial processes resulting in PDF 
files. These files, in turn, may be printed in quantity on a desktop 
printer for distribution or given to a commercial printer for reproduction.

%% Programmer's perspective 
%% *****************************************************************


Programmer’s perspective

erlPress strives to automate as much of the user workflow as possible and to deliver the most intuitive possible user interface.

At heart, erlPress involves positioning boxes of various size in two-dimensional space.

Boxes contain other boxes, graphic elements, and text. Much of the code involves translating sets of xy coordinates relative to other xy coordinates. Boxes define the “selected areas” in which output devices “paint” graphic elements and text.

Operationally, “paint” is implemented as sequences of PDF and postscript operators defined in the PDF reference manual.

%% Concepts, technical terms, and jargon 
%% *****************************************************************


Concepts, technical terms, and jargon

The history of printing and graphic design stretches back to Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of movable type in 1439 and, no doubt, before.

A rich and descriptive technical vocabulary that facilitates efficient teamwork in the production of printed documents has evolved over over the centuries and is used widely in graphic design studios and print shops today.

For this reason, erlPress employs technical terms and concepts drawn from print/graphic design tradition as well as terms defined in the PDF reference manual.

We've added a few technical terms and jaron of our own.

Here are a few terms that will serve you well as you review and work with erlPress code:


%% *****************************************************************
%% Content
%% *****************************************************************

CONTENT

erlPress composes "content elements" to generate PDF files. Content 
includes text, images, and geometric objects. Text may be presented
as "text_blocks", e.g. raw text; "articles"; or "manuscripts." 

Content elements have one or more attributes that define the 
position, size, and other attributes of the element. These attributes
are represented as Erlang maps in erlPress.


%% *****************************************************************
%% Job 
%% *****************************************************************

JOB

A "print job" is represented as an Erlang map in erlPress:

create(Title, Publisher) ->
   #{ title          => Title
    , publisher      => Publisher
    , path           => "./publishers/" ++ Publisher ++ "/jobs"
    , directory      => re:replace(Title, " ", "_", [global, {return, list}])
    , author         => undefined
    , subject        => undefined
    , description    => undefined
    , keywords       => undefined
    , start_date     => ep_lib:today()
    , deadline       => undefined
    , paper_stock    => ?PAPER_STOCK
    , page_format    => ?PAGE_FORMAT
   }.


%% *****************************************************************
%% Metrics 
%% *****************************************************************

METRICS

Printers use picas and points as primary units of measure.

1 pica  = 1/6 inch
1 point = 12 picas

erlPress uses points for all positioning and size specifications. 

erlPress copyfitting routines use 1/1000th of a pica as unit of 
measure between glyphs. 

To convert a position or size tuple specified in inches, e.g. {X, Y}
or {Width, Height}, to points, execute ...ep_metrics:to_points/2


%% *****************************************************************
%% Paper stock 
%% *****************************************************************

PAPER STOCK

Printers feed "paper stock" through their printers to reproduce
printed matter.

To see list of of standard paper sizes used by printers, execute
...ep_paper_stock:standard_sizes/0.

To convert paper stock specified in inches to points, execute
..ep_paper_stock:stock_size_points/1.

To see selected list of paper stock suitable for desktop printers,
execute ..ep_paper_stock:desktop_printer_stock/0.


%% *****************************************************************
%% Boxes 
%% *****************************************************************

BOXES

Rectangles or "boxes" are convenient abstractions for placing 
content elements on a page.

The PDF reference manual Ver. 1.4 specifies several nested boxes; p. 677:

-- Media box 
-- Crop box
-- Bleed box
-- Trim box
-- Art box

Media box is essentially synonomous with dimensions paper stock.

Crop box "defines the region to which the contents of the page are to be
clipped (cropped) when displayed or printed... the crop box will
determine how the page's contents are to be positioned on the output
medium."

Bleed box "defines the region to which the contents of the page should
be clipped when output in a production environment. This may include
some extra 'bleed area' needed to accomodate the physical limitations
of cutting, folding, and trimming equipment."

Trim box "defines the intended dimensions of the finished page after
trimming... The default value is the page's crop box."

Art box "defines the extent of the page's meaningful content... as 
intended by the page's creator."


%% *****************************************************************
%% Imposition 
%% *****************************************************************

IMPOSITION

Imposition refers to how the crop box is positioned on the output
medium. If the page is sufficiently smaller than the paper stock
on which it's printed, a bookmark or postcard say, it may be possible 
to print two or more pages on the same sheet. 


%% *****************************************************************
%% Format 
%% *****************************************************************

FORMAT

Format refers to the size and intended functionality of the final
printed piece. 

To see list of formats supported by erlPress, execute
rp(ep_format:formats()).

To trim sizes, rp(ep_format:format_list()).


%% *****************************************************************
%% Page grid 
%% *****************************************************************

PAGE GRID 

Graphic designers create "page grids" to organize content on a page.

A page grid is a composition of boxes, each of which represents a block
of text or image.

A well-designed page grid presents a pleasing composition, organized
content, and a controlled "eye-path" guiding the consumer through
the content.

Page grids are represented by a list of "panels" in erlPress.


%% *****************************************************************
%% Panel 
%% *****************************************************************

PANEL

In erlPress, a panel is a box that has width, height, a name and a unique 
index number relative to other panels on the page.
