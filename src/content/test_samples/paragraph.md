  This is normal text with *emphasized terms*. It implements the TeX\nhyphenation algorithm.\nIt includes *cursive text* and an Erlang term, `{person, \"Joe\"}`. \nThe variable `X`, is immediately followed by\na comma. The justification algorithm does proper _kerning_,\nwhich is more than *Microsoft Word* can do. AWAY is\ncorrectly kerned! Erlang terms `{like, this}`\nare typeset in `courier`.
