times_14() ->
"<p>This is normal text set in 14/21 Times Roman.
It includes <em>emphasized terms,</em> set in Times-Italic. The TeX
hyphenation algorithm is implemented.  The term <code>{person, 
\"Joe\"}</code> is an Erlang term.
The variable <code>X</code>, was immediately followed by
a comma. The justification algorithm does proper <em>kerning</em>.
AWAY is correctly kerned! Erlang terms <code>{like, this}</code>
are typeset in <em>courier.</em></p>".


%% @doc  Display Helvetica 10pt text
%% NOTE: Must apply ep_typespec:default_helvetics(10) for this to 
%%       show advertised font size 

helvetica_10() ->
    "<p>This is normal text set in 10/15 Helvetica.
It includes <em>emphasized terms,</em> set in Helvetica-Oblique. The TeX
hyphenation algorithm is implemented.  The term <code>{person, 
\"Joe\"}</code> is an Erlang term.
The variable <code>X</code>, was immediately followed by
a comma. The justification algorithm does proper <em>kerning</em>.
 AWAY is correctly kerned! Erlang terms <code>{like, this}</code>
are typeset in <em>courier.</em></p>".


the_road_not_taken() ->
"<p>  </p>
<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
     <p> - <em>Robert Frost</em></p>".


article() ->
"<h1>This is a headline</h1>
<h2>This is a deck</h2>
<p>    </p>
<p>This is normal text set in 14/21 Times Roman.
It includes <em>emphasized terms,</em> set in Times-Italic. The TeX
hyphenation algorithm is implemented.  The term <code>{person, 
\"Joe\"}</code> is an Erlang term.</p>
<h3>This is a subhead</h3>
<p>The variable <code>X</code>, was immediately followed by
a comma. The justification algorithm does proper <em>kerning</em>,
which is more than <em>Microsoft Word</em> can do. AWAY is
correctly kerned! Erlang terms <code>{like, this}</code>
are typeset in <em>courier.</em></p>".



erlpress() ->
"<h1>erlPress_core</h1>
<br> </br>
<p>Generate PDFs from your Erlang applications!</p>
<p>User applications based on the Adobe Portable Document Format, PDF, compose text, images, 2-D geometric objects, and presentation instructions for distribution across diverse output devices. The goal is faithful and consistent display of human-readable content. Presentation instructions are encoded in the page description language Adobe PostScript.</p>
<p><em>erlPress_core.01</em> functions transform human-readable content into Erlang data structures, generate Postscript object code, and format the code into properly structured PDF files. Based on <em>PDF Reference: third edition, Version 1.4</em>, <em>erlPress_lib.01</em> provides functions to:</p>
<br> </br>
<li>Display Adobe Type I fonts</li>
<li>Position and copyfit text</li>
<li>Justify, kern, and rotate text</li>
<li>Specify and position images and graphic elements</li>
<li>Support checklists</li>
<br> </br>
<p><em>erlPress_lib.01</em> revises and extends the Hugh Watkins fork of the Erlang Erlguten library originally developed by Joe Armstrong. See: <em>https://github.com/hwatkins/erlguten</em></p>
<h3>Roadmap:</h3>
<br> </br>
<ci>Extend and debug Markdown parsing</ci>
<ci>Ordered lists</ci>
<ci>Footnotes</ci>
<ci>Tables</ci>
<ci>Articles and beads</ci>
<ci>Test! Test! Test!</ci>
<ci>TrueType and OpenType fonts</ci>
<ci>Impostion and layout functions</ci>
<ci>PDF-to-Erlang functions</ci>
<ci>Applications for diverse print formats</ci>
<br> </br>
<p><em>erlPress_core.01</em> provides a foundation for development of Erlang applications that support creative generation of print formats ranging from business cards to technical books. We immodestly imagine the evolution of a comprehensive Human Communication Platform, HCP, parallel to OTP.</p>
